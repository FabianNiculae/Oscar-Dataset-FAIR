# Oscar-Dataset-FAIR

The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) version of the Oscar Awards dataset is hosted by this GitHub repository. To improve its usability and compliance with best practices in data management and sharing, the dataset has been transformed. Among the notable contributions are:

Linking to Wikidata URIs: All of the dataset's cells are now linked to distinct URIs from Wikidata, creating obvious links to reliable information sources.

RDF Skeleton: The dataset has been converted to the RDF (Resource Description Framework) format, which ensures that the data may be readily merged with other linked data sources and is highly interoperable.

Metadata Schema: To characterize the content and structure of the dataset, a thorough metadata schema has been developed. By making data documentation easier to comprehend and reuse, this design enhances data documentation.
